### Opening a PR

Use when creating or publishing a PR is within the user's delivery scope. A local change ends with its diff and native evidence; this playbook does not add publication authorization.

**Worktree.** Inspect the current branch, worktree, and existing changes first. Reuse a suitable isolated checkout or create one from the actual task base when independent writers need separation. Use the current host's delegation API and pass each worker its checkout and exclusive paths. Preserve user changes, ignored data, and other workers' edits; do not reset a shared checkout or move unrelated work to make this task easier. Integrate through one owner.

**Commits.** Keep task-owned changes in small ordered commits when committing is authorized. Amend or rebase only when the actual branch and integration need it and authorization covers rewriting its history. Preserve other contributors' work. A commit is a reviewable unit within its Plan, not automatically another Plan or PR.

**PRs.** Review unnecessary code over the diff before commit. Use `/deslop` from `cursor-team-kit` if available; otherwise inspect the diff directly for narrating comments, unsupported guards, dead compatibility paths, and unrelated edits. Do not install a plugin merely to run this step. Run `/no-comments` before review. Write every PR title, PR description, and commit body with `/technical-writing`, then apply `/unslop`. Apply every technical-writing layer except Diátaxis. Use one word for each action, keep articles, and avoid `-ing` when a plain verb works.

**Titles.** Use Conventional Commits in the form `type(scope): subject`. Use `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `perf` as the type. Use the changed area, such as `pstack` or `poteto-mode`, as the scope. Keep the subject short and imperative. Name a real symbol when one carries the change. For example, `fix(pstack): retarget opening-a-pr babysit trigger`. Do not add a trailing period.

**Descriptions.** The PR body is a briefing, not the lab notebook. A reviewer who has the diff should learn why the change exists, what it leaves out, what it could break, and how you proved it works, in under a minute. Write short, simple sentences with few identifiers. Do not write walls of text. The squash commit body is the PR body. If the body would make the squash commit longer than about 40 lines, cut the body.

Put each section under a `##` heading, not a bold lead-in, so the sections stand apart. Use these sections in order. Drop a section when it has nothing to say.

- `## Why` gives the problem and the approach in one to three short sentences. Do not list SHAs or rebase genealogy. Do not add a "based on main" preamble.
- `## What changed` has one to three short bullets. Name a real symbol or path only when it carries the change. Name both sides of a rename or retarget.
- `## Scope` always names what the PR covers and what it deliberately leaves out, for example a related follow-up or a known gap. Use one to three short items. Do not list symbols or paths, and do not write a file-by-file essay.
- `## Tradeoffs` names only rejected alternatives that a reviewer would otherwise ask about. Skip this section when there was no real choice.
- `## Blast Radius` gives one or two sentences on who or what the change touches and why that is safe or risky. If main is red, state the cost of leaving it red.
- `## Verification` has one to three bullets. Each bullet names a real run path and its outcome. For a performance change, report one primary number with its unit in `before → after` form. Link the arena or swarm directory for the remaining evidence. Do not include sample-size methodology, swarm recitals, or metric tables.

After these sections, attach videos or screenshots when they prove a claim. Do not paste full SHAs, swarm or arena lane recitals, lever-correction essays, file-by-file checklists, or "CLEAN" verdicts. Put these details in a linked artifact. A commit body does not restate its subject.

**Forge.** Resolve the forge before the first PR operation and keep that choice for create, edit, view, watch, and merge. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the default. If `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, prefer `origin pr ...`. If Origin is absent or cannot resolve the repository, stay on `gh` and record the fallback. Do not require Graphite (`gt`).

**Built-in PR tool.** When the run provides a built-in PR tool, create, edit, retarget, and mark ready through it, never through a forge CLI. Its own instructions say how. A PR made with the CLI misses what the tool tracks, such as a description later runs can edit. Use the resolved forge for everything the tool does not cover, and for every PR operation when the run has no such tool.

**Size and stacks.** Prefer five narrow PRs to one large PR. A stack is a base-branch chain. The root PR targets trunk. Each child branch rebases onto its parent's exact tip and its PR targets the parent branch. Without a built-in PR tool, create a child with `origin pr create --status open --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <parent-branch>` according to the resolved forge, and retarget an existing child with `origin pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>`. Branch from trunk only for independent work. Rebase on trunk before substantial stack work.

**Readiness.** Open a PR ready after its required verification and review are complete; retain draft status when the user requests it or unresolved work remains. Set readiness through the supported fields of the actual PR tool; do not assume a particular creation schema. For a ready PR, pass `--status open` with Origin or omit `--draft` with `gh`. When verification and review are complete and ready status is intended, mark a draft ready through the actual tool, or run `origin pr ready <number>` or `gh pr ready <number>` according to the resolved forge. Run `origin pr view <number>` or `gh pr view <number>` before you refer to PR status.

**Babysit.** Opening a PR does not start a babysit. Post the URL and keep building. Finish the phase or stack first. Run a separate babysit pass only when the user asks for one after the whole stack exists. A babysit for each new PR stalls the build and spends checks on commits that later waves restart. Push back when feedback drifts from intent.

A subagent authorized to open a PR performs the diff cleanup and `/no-comments`; it uses `interrogate` when the design is contested. It posts the actual URL and returns to the parent without babysitting unless an Autopilot-full or Autopilot-stack owner's brief assigns that loop. The assigned owner starts the loop after its code-ready report and reports merge-ready as its playbook says. That explicit assignment is the ask `playbooks/babysit.md` waits for.
