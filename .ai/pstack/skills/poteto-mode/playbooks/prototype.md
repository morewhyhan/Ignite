### Prototype

**You own the design decision, not the code. The prototype is a throwaway instrument. The real build follows Feature.**

Use an isolated throwaway sketch to resolve a decision that existing facts cannot answer. Keep production code and native acceptance separate. Record a consequential decision in the existing Plan without creating another planning register.

1. Scope the decision the prototype exists to make: which layout, which interaction, which density, or for an empirical fork which behavior, timing, or approach. No decision means no prototype. Route to Feature.
   Read existing code, logs, tests, design facts, and relevant evidence first. If they settle the choice, use them. Build a prototype only when the remaining uncertainty could change the action.
2. Gather references when the design space is open. Search for prior art, summarize a moodboard of themes, palettes, and layouts, let the user pick directions before building. Skip when the direction is set.
3. Build throwaway in an isolated scratch dir, separate from production source. For a visual decision, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS or the lightest stack that renders the idea, CDN deps, a dev server with hot reload. For a behavioral or timing decision, the smallest script that exercises the question. No production framework, no tests, no abstractions.
4. When comparing alternatives, build them behind one switcher (buttons or a keypress), each variant labeled. This is the **exhaust-the-design-space** principle skill made cheap.
5. Verify on the matching surface. For a visual decision, screenshot each variant via the control skill and drive the interaction. For a behavioral or timing decision, observe the thing you are deciding by logging the timing, printing the output, or watching the render. The observation is the test here, not an assertion.
6. Present alternatives, tradeoffs, and a recommendation. The output is the decision plus the throwaway artifact, not shippable code. Hand the chosen direction to **Feature** (or `architect` for the shape) for the real build.

**Reply:** the variants explored, the evidence (screenshots for a visual decision, the observed output or timing for a behavioral one), tradeoffs, your recommendation, and the scratch path. Say plainly that the prototype is throwaway.
